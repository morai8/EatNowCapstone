## Summary

Being healthy is important because it affects every aspect of our lives. When we prioritize our health, we feel better physically and mentally. Maintaining an ideal BMI is one of the solutions. To help with this, we want to build an application that provides an easy and convenient way for users to prepare delicious and healthy meals. The food recipe recommendations application is designed to provide users with personalized recipe recommendations based on the ingredients they have at home. By scanning the ingredients using their smartphone camera, the app provides a list of suggested recipes that the user can prepare using the ingredients they have. The app considers the user's BMI and recommends recipes that are suitable for their dietary needs. The app also includes a daily calorie count feature to help users track their caloric intake and maintain a healthy weight.
